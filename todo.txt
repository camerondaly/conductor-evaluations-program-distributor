1. read files from google drive
[] write basic logic to connect and open sheets
[] processed and unprocessed folder
- move to processed after collector is made succesfully
[] read data from specific files. one file per distribution (collector)
- conductor name
- program name
- recipient emails
- concert (and thereby distribution) time
[] update sheet to track programs already distributed?

2. create distribution (collector) in Surveymonkey
[] check if a collector with this conductor name and concert name already exists. skip sheet if so. does_collector_with_this_name_already_exist
- Set display_settings to overwrite "survey_title" with the name of conductor and program from sheet
- use recipients from sheet
- set reminders 6 days after
- close 7 days later
