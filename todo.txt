1. read files from google drive
[x] write basic logic to connect and open sheets
[x] processed and unprocessed folder
[x] read data from specific files. one file per distribution (collector)
- conductor name
- program name
- recipient emails
- concert (and thereby distribution) time
[x] move to processed folder when collector is made or synced

2. create new survey from tempalte copy. and create distribution (collector) in Surveymonkey
[x] check if survey exists
[x] create survey from template
[x] check if collector with this conductor name and concert name already exists. 
[x] avoid duplicating collector w same name
- if it already exists, update the recipients, but don't create a new collector.
- use recipients from sheet
- set reminders 6 days after
- close 7 days later

[x]collector
- if survey exists, skip creation
- if collector exists, skip collector creation
- if message on collector exists, skip creation

[x] Add librarians back in before go-live


misc issues
[x] KEY TODO: MAKE THE SURVEY IDENTIFY THE CONDUCTOR SOMEHOW. PIPED TEXT? COLLECTOR NAME? CUSTOM VARIABLE?
- just stick to new survey per conductor
[x] MAKE SURE OPERA EVENT NAMES HAVE "OPERA" IN THEM WHEN PM ADDS THEM
[x] TODO: remove test folder ID and replate with automation folder id
[x] TODO: ensure the reminder automatically inherits recipient list from the invite list and only those who did not respond. 

TEST CASES
[x] removing recipient from collector also removes from invite message?
[x] invalid date won't send immediately? instead should throw and print error
[x] invalid emails are printed w a warning and skipped
[x] Opera template is used when Event Title contains "opera" case insensitive
[x] what if first and or last name is blank

FUTURE UPDATES:
[ ] Joe comments
[ ] if x contact deletions, just delete collector and recreate to reduce API calls vs 1 per contact deletion?
